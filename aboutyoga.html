<h1><p>Kundalini Yoga (as thaught by Yogi Bhajan)</p>
    The word yoga comes from the Sanskrit word “Yuj” which means joke, a joke both separates and unites, depending on the philosophic school most interpret it as “to unite”, to leave no aspect of your mind and body separated but to integrate it all into your state of being.
    If your idea of yoga is of difficult poses and human pretzels Kundalini Yoga might surprise you. Off course we do complex poses now and then but this style of yoga consists mostly of a combination of dynamic exercises, breathing techniques, meditation, relaxation and singing (the last is encouraged, but if you prefer to listen that is perfectly alright).
    It is called the Yoga of Awareness, you get in touch with your body and your mind and will learn to become friends with them.
