<h1> Welcome beautiful soul! Thank you for visiting Dancing Water, the yoga company!</h1>
<p>All to often our lives are thrown back and forth between resembling a wild waterfall and resembling the bogged down water of a swamp. Years ago one of my teachers gave me a card with a picture of a fountain and the message: be like the dancing water. My yoga classes intend to contribute to you finding a middle ground between your extremes, where things are both wild and calm and there is no need to shift back and forth.
    On this website you will information about me, the yoga I teach and of course where and how you can join my classes.
    Enjoy!
    </p>
