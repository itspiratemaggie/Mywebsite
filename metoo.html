        <h1>In 2019 I got my degree of level 1 instructor in Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan. You can guess that this guy calles Yogi Bhajan was (he passed away in 2004) quite a central figure in this style of yoga. Arriving in the United States in the late 1960’s he stated that he had taken this thousands year old tradition to the West and little by little starting with small classes a yoga empire was built. And an empire has a hierarchy with Mister Bhajan rising above them all. The man was revered and worshipped and so were many yoga teachers that he had trained. They were guru’s, godmen, towering above the mire of the human condition.</h1>
        <p>There always had been rumours, stories about manipulation and abuse in the community. But they were hardly taken serious. But in 2020 a book was published, a book called “Premka: White Bird in a Golden Cage: My Life with Yogi Bhajan.”. In this book a former student who had worked very closely with Mister Bhajan told in gruesome detail about the abuse she suffered at his hand. In the wake of this book hundreds of other people (predominantly women) came forward finally finding an ear for their stories of abuse by either Mister Bhajan or other renowned kundalini yoga teachers. The stories are sickening not just by its detail but the fact that young people were pressured into performing or undergoing sexual acts under the guise of it being beneficial for their spiritual development.</p>
        <p>But still I teach this form of yoga…why? The stories about what happened tore open some very old personal wounds, my own experiences with manipulation and abuse. Around that time I was reading “The Glass pearl Game” by Hermann Hesse, in this book Hesse makes an argument for a spiritual life that is not excluding the eros and thanatos of the human condition from view. Not focused on the light so much that it forgets about the existence of the dark. Further as of this moment I trust that the 3HO association (the umbrella organization of this kundalini yoga) is taking this serious and is making a very sincere effort to move forward shedding all that was despicable.</p>
        <p>But!!!</p>
        <p>I do want you to be informed about this before you decide to take classes with me.</p>
        <p>I have three rules set for myself and the people taking my classes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Do not revere me or any other teacher, and don’t even think about worshipping me/them. I/we are human just like you.</li>
            <li> You and you alone can make decisions about yourself and especially your sexuality, never feel pressured to act in ways that you are not comfortable with at that moment. I can present you options, but you will always be the only one to make the pick.</li>
            <li> -	I will personally give all my effort to provide a safe space to everyone regardless of gender identity, racial background, sexual preference, age, looks etcetera.</li>
        </ul>
