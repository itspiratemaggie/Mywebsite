<h1><p>Nam Harjeet Singh (Lars)</p>
    I must have been a young adolescent, but thirty later I remember the moment quite vividly. The moment that I somehow got the idea that in order to be happy I should conform. The confusions about my gender identity and evolving sexuality: if I would ignore them hard enough all would be well. A long period of running away for myself started. If I drink hard enough those ‘abnormal’ feelings would probably go away at some point. And when that didn’t work: if I work, study or pray hard enough etcetera etcetera. Yoga at first was my next strategy to make this bothering thoughts, feelings and desires miraculously disappear somehow. But after a few weeks of taking classes with my first teacher Hari Bir Singh the opposite happened.  For the first time in my life I started accepting my true being. All those things that I wanted to get rid of are allowed to be there, your true self is allowed to be.
    Since years Kundalini Yoga is a lifestyle and daily practice for me. It has taken me through all the highs and lows of life since then. A result which I share with everyone with pleasure, but especially tot everyone that is in one way or another part of the LGBTQ community. Know one thing: you are welcome, you are allowed to be.
